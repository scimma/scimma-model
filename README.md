# scimma-model
This is an Archimate model of SCiMMA, documenting architecture implemented through point-and-click activities in the AWS web console.

You will need Archi with Collaboration plugin installed to load and edit this model. You can get a pre-built Archi distribution here: https://github.com/ncsa/NCSA-Archi

Then, you will need to click Collaboration -> Import Remote Modle to Workspace.
